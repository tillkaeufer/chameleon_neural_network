# chameleon_neural_network
This Repository gives all data and information that are needed to partizipate in the neural networks hands-on session of the first CHAMELEON school.

## Things to install before the session

Please install the following things before the session.

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
For doing so, the easiest way is to create an anaconda environment: </br>

If you have problems, please contact us.

Also, the following packages are needed:
- SKlearn: conda install scikit-learn
- Keras/Tensorflow: conda install tensorflow
- numpy: conda install numpy
- matplotlib: conda install matplotlib
- corner: conda install -c conda-forge corner

## How this will work
We prepared two different problems, which can be solved using Machine Learning.
First problem:
Extracting exoplanet parameters using spectra.
...
Seconda problem:
Emulating SED modelling of protoplanetary disks.
...
## How to start

- Decide on  a dataset you want to anaylze.
- Set up a notebook 
- Import the needed packages
- Inport the data
- Scale your data
- Import a ML technique and adjust it
- Analyze the results
- Start playing with different settings and techniques to find the best results
